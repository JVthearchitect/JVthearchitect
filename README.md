# Hi there, hello! ðŸ‘‹

## GitHub README Chess Tournament

This is an open chess tournament where ANYONE can play. That's the fun part.  
It's your turn to play! Move a <!-- BEGIN TURN -->?<!-- END TURN --> piece.

<!-- BEGIN CHESS BOARD -->
(Here goes the chess board)
<!-- END CHESS BOARD -->

**It's your turn to move! Choose one from the following table**
<!-- BEGIN MOVES LIST -->
(Here goes the list of legal moves)
<!-- END MOVES LIST -->

Having fun? Ask a friend to do the next move!

#### How it works

When you click on a link and submit a new issue with the desired move, a GitHub action is triggered, which in turn runs a small python script that performs the specified movement, updates this README file and commits the changes.

Have you spotted a bug? Something missing? Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/marcizhu/readme-chess/issues) and I will try to fix it as soon as possible :D
